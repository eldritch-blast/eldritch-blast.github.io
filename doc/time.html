<h2 id="length-of-the-day">length of the day</h2>
<p>There are two leading accounts of the nature of the day. Some say that a day is the duration of time in which a soul wakes, is active, and sleeps again. This corresponds to a cycle of light and darkness, for those without darkvision take their rest when it is dark, and are active when there is light, and even those who are active at night merely invert this cycle rather than extending it.</p>

<p>Others say that a day should be counted from the time from one sunrise to the next. In this way of reckoning the day, a soul will pass through a cycle of activity and slumber three times, and <em>Elubar</em> will once pass through the shadow of <em>Gaervenel</em> and once be illuminated by his coppery mirror.</p>

<p>The latter of these ways of reckoning is better and more in the spirit of exact knowledge and science. Those who count the days as a cycle of light and dark cannot measure a day exactly, because the time of eclipse is shorter in duration than the other two periods of darkness, and the time in which <em>Gaervenel</em> illuminates the world is likewise shorter than the other two periods of light. Therefore, if we count the days as these people do, every third day will be somewhat longer, the length of a day will not be fixed.</p>

<p>However, those who prefer the cycle of light and dark say that the purpose of the day is to regulate the activity of mortals, and so the best definition of the day will be that which illuminates its purpose, which is to be the time in which souls go through a cycle of activity and passivity. On the other hand, there are souls that do not appear to activate on this cycle, such as the souls of trees and fish and elemental spirits. But these philosophers will say that the highest purpose of the day is to regulate the activity of the highest and most divine souls, and these do take their activity in one day.</p>

<p>This way of counting days is therefore the way that shows the cause or principal of the day, whereas counting from sunrise to sunrise is more exact. It is certainly true that to explain a thing is to state its cause or principal, but where quantities and exact motion are concerned it is better to provide a mathematical explanation. And since we are here concerned foremost not with mortal souls but with heavenly bodies, mathematical understanding is best suited to our purpose. For that reason, while the comman person may say that a day is a cycle of light and dark, for our part we say that it is the period from sunrise to sunrise.</p>

<h2 id="primary-heavenly-bodies">primary heavenly bodies</h2>
<p>The heavens contain three primary bodies, of which the most familiar but least understood is <em>Elubar</em>, for <em>Elubar</em> is what the elves call the body on which mortal souls reside. And it was the elves who first demonstrated that the shape of the world is a sphere.</p>

<p>Nearer than the sun is <em>Gaervenel</em>, the dominant body in the heavens and the most constant, for it is always visible. The priests say that <em>Gaervenel</em> is both a friend and enemy of mortal souls, for once each day it jealously blocks the light of the sun, and once each night it illuminates the darkness.</p>

<p><em>Gaervenel</em>, however, is not the most divine or knowable of the heavenly bodies. For the sun itself, which the elves call <em>Anorel</em> is a greater source of light, and even <em>Gaervenel</em> cannot completely obscure its radiance during the daily eclipse. The sun, however, is the most distant of all the heavenly bodies.</p>

<h2 id="secondary-heavenly-bodies">secondary heavenly bodies</h2>
<p>After the primary bodies, there are two others by whose movements time is known. <em>Haerdh</em> is the nearest and most familiar of these, for it appears nearly half of the time, and it is when the sun is set, and <em>Gaervenel</em> illuminates the world, and <em>Haerdh</em> disappears behind it that is the customary day of rest.</p>

<p>Finally there is <em>Cúranel</em>, whose movements are the most mysterious and unknowable of all the celestial bodies, and by which the months are known. <em>Cúranel</em> is said to be the most beautiful of the heavenly bodies. However, for those who prize knowledge above all else, <em>Cúranel</em> appears less divine than the others, though there is still more to be known of <em>Cúranel</em> than the priests tell.</p>

<h2 id="minor-heavenly-bodies">minor heavenly bodies</h2>
<p>If we wish to be complete in our account, we must also understand the movements of the smaller stars. The influence of these minor bodies cannot be completely discounted, especially when we consider their natural grouping into constellations.</p>
