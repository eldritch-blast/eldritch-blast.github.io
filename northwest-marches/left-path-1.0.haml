        %p.small
          You are from the distant land of 中原. Your homeland is so remote that most residents of Skarvost have never heard of it, and those that have know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to the northwest marches area for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share.
        %p.small
          As a poor orphan, you were raised in a monastery. As a teenager, the monastery was attacked and destroyed. Baiqian led a contingent of soldiers to drive off the attackers, but it was too late; most of the monks were dead, and the monastery burned. She found you dying and healed you, and ever since you have been her devoted protector, guide, and translator.
