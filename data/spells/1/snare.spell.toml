description = ["As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.", "This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.", "The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spellâ€™s radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends.", "A restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends.", "After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is restrained by it."]
