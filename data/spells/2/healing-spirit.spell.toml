The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice). Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirits space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore ld6 hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit canâ€™t heal constructs or undead. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the Spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see."]
