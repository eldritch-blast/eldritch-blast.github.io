Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.", "As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spellâ€™s range."]
