<div class='school'>1st-level divination</div>
<div class='casting-time'>1 action</div>
<div class='range'>Self</div>
<div class='components'>V, S</div>
<div class='duration'>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</div>
<p>
For the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.
</p>
<p>
The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
</p>
</div>
<div class='card'>
<h3>Detect Magic</h3>
<div class='level'>1</div>
<div class='school'>1st-level divination (ritual)</div>
<div class='casting-time'>1 action</div>
<div class='range'>Self</div>
<div class='components'>V, S</div>
<div class='duration'>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</div>
<p>
For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.
</p>
<p>
The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
</p>

<h3>Detect Poison and Disease</h3>
<div class='level'>1</div>
<div class='school'>1st-level divination</div>
<div class='casting-time'>1 action</div>
<div class='range'>Self</div>
<div class='components'>V, S, M (a yew leaf)</div>
<div class='duration'>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</div>

<h3>Disguise Self</h3>
<div class='level'>1</div>
<div class='school'>1st-level illusion</div>
<div class='casting-time'>1 action</div>
<div class='range'>Self</div>
<div class='duration'>1 hour</div>
<p>
You make yourself&mdash;including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person&mdash;look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
</p>
<p>
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
</p>
<p>
To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
</p>
</div>
<div class='card'>
<h3>Guiding Bolt</h3>
<div class='level'>1</div>
<div class='school'>1st-level evocation</div>
<div class='casting-time'>1 action</div>
<div class='range'>120 feet</div>
<div class='duration'>1 round</div>
<p>
A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.
</p>
<p>
<span class='title'>At Higher Levels.</span>
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

<div class='components'>V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)</div>
<div class='duration'>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</div>
<p>
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.
</p>
<p>
The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

<div class='components'>V, S, M (a small silver mirror)</div>
<div class='duration'>1 minute</div>
<p>
You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.
</p>
<p>
If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.
</p>
</div>

<div class='range'>30 feet</div>
<div class='components'>V</div>
<div class='duration'>1 minute</div>
<p>
You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is either blinded or deafened (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.
</p>
<p>
<span class='title'>At Higher Levels.</span>
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

<div class='range'>60 feet</div>
<div class='components'>V, S</div>
<div class='duration'>Concentration, up to 1 minute</div>
<p>
You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.
</p>
<p>
You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.
</p>
</div>

<div class='duration'>Until dispelled</div>
<p>
A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A
<span class='spell'>continual flame</span>
can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.
</p>
</div>
<div class='blank-page'></div>

<div class='casting-time'>1 action</div>
<div class='range'>120 feet</div>
<div class='components'>V, S</div>
<div class='duration'>Instantaneous</div>
<p>
You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the
<span class='spell'>alarm</span>
spell, a
<span class='spell'>glyph of warding,</span>
or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
</p>
</div>
<div class='card'>
<h3>Gentle Repose</h3>
<div class='level'>2</div>
<div class='school'>2nd-level necromancy (ritual)</div>

<div class='duration'>10 days</div>
<p>
You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can't become undead.
</p>
<p>
The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit of spells such as
<span class='spell'>raise dead.</span>
</p>
</div>
<div class='card'>
<h3>Hold Person</h3>
<div class='level'>2</div>
<div class='school'>2nd-level enchantment</div>

<div class='range'>60 feet</div>
<div class='components'>V, S, M (a small, straight piece of iron)</div>
<div class='duration'>Concentration, up to 1 minute</div>
<p>
Choose a humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.
</p>
<p>
<span class='title'>At Higher Levels.</span>
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional humanoid for each slot level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
</p>

<div class='range'>Self</div>
<div class='components'>V, S, M (a forked twig)</div>
<div class='duration'>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</div>
<p>
Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the object's location, as long as that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.
</p>
<p>
The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close--within 30 feet--at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.
</p>
<p>
This spell can't locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.
</p>
</div>
<div class='card'>
<h3>Mirror Image</h3>
<div class='level'>2</div>
<div class='school'>2nd-level illusion</div>
<div class='casting-time'>1 action</div>
<div class='range'>Self</div>
<div class='components'>V, S</div>
<div class='duration'>1 minute</div>
<p>
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.
</p>
<p>
Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.
</p>
<p>
If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
</p>
<p>
A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
</p>
<p>
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.
</p>
</div>

<div class='duration'>Concentration, up to 1 hour</div>
<p>
A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

<div class='casting-time'>1 action</div>
<div class='range'>Touch</div>
<div class='components'>V, S</div>
<div class='duration'>1 hour</div>
<p>
You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.
</p>
<p>
For the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.

<h3>Silence</h3>

<div class='casting-time'>1 action</div>
<div class='range'>120 feet</div>
<div class='components'>V, S</div>
<div class='duration'>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</div>
<p>
For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

<h3>Spiritual Weapon</h3>

<div class='casting-time'>1 bonus action</div>
<div class='range'>60 feet</div>
<div class='components'>V, S</div>
<div class='duration'>1 minute</div>
<p>
You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
</p>
<p>
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.
</p>
<p>
The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.

<h3>Warding Bond</h3>
<div class='level'>2</div>
<div class='school'>2nd-level abjuration</div>
<div class='casting-time'>1 action</div>
<div class='range'>Touch</div>
<div class='components'>V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)</div>
<div class='duration'>1 hour</div>
<p>
This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.
</p>
<p>
The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.

<h3>Zone of Truth</h3>
<div class='level'>2</div>
<div class='school'>2nd-level enchantment</div>
<div class='casting-time'>1 action</div>
<div class='range'>60 feet</div>
<div class='components'>V, S</div>
<div class='duration'>10 minutes</div>
<p>
You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.
</p>
<p>
An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.

<div class='range'>Self</div>
<div class='components'>V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)</div>
<div class='duration'>Instantaneous</div>
<p>
By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class='emph'>Weal,</span>
for good results
</li>
<li>
<span class='emph'>Woe,</span>
for bad results
</li>
<li>
<span class='emph'>Weal and woe,</span>
for both good and bad results
</li>
<li>
<span class='emph'>Nothing,</span>
for results that aren't especially good or bad
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.
</p>
<p>
If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

<div class='casting-time'>1 action</div>
<div class='range'>60 feet</div>
<div class='components'>V</div>
<div class='duration'>1 round</div>
<p>
You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.
</p>
<p>
Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the spell ends.
</p>
<p>
<span class='title'>Approach.</span>
The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.
</p>
<p>
<span class='title'>Drop.</span>
The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.
</p>
<p>
<span class='title'>Flee.</span>
The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.
</p>
<p>
<span class='title'>Grovel.</span>
The target falls prone and then ends its turn.
</p>
<p>
<span class='title'>Halt.</span>
The target doesn't move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum
