<div class='school'>2<sup>nd</sup>-level divination</div>
<div class='casting-time'>1 action</div>
<div class='range'>self</div>
<div class='components'>V, S, M(a forked twig)</div>
<div class='duration'>Concentration, up to 10 minutes</div>

</p>
<p>
The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close – within 30 feet – at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.
</p>
<p>
This spell can’t locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.

<h3>Zone of Truth</h3>
<div class='level'>2</div>
<div class='school'>2<sup>nd</sup>-level enchantment</div>
<div class='casting-time'>1 action</div>
<div class='range'>60 feet</div>
<div class='components'>V, S</div>
<div class='duration'>10 minutes</div>
<p>
You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range.
</p>
<p>
Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.
</p>
<p>
An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such creatures can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.

<h3>Find Steed</h3>
<div class='level'>2</div>
<div class='school'>2<sup>nd</sup>-level conjuration</div>
<div class='casting-time'>10 minutes</div>
<div class='range'>30 feet</div>
<div class='components'>V, S</div>
<div class='duration'>Instantaneous</div>
<p>
You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose, such as a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your DM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.
</p>
<p>
Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.
</p>
<p>
When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to
</p>

<div class='card'>
<p>
disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.
</p>
<p>
While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. You can’t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.
